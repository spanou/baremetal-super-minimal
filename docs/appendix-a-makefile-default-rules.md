# Appendix A - Makefile Default Rules & Variables

Makefile comes with a set of default rules and variables that can be overridden to alter the default functionality. 


In order to see what the default rules and variables are, please do the following in a directory that doesn't already have a Makefile available.

```bash
spanou@qemu-m4:~/development/c/baremetal-super-minimal/docs$ make -p
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
```

The output can be found in the [Listing of Default Rules and  Variables](#listing-of-default-rules-and-variables)


```
```
